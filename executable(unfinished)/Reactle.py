#file that contains the code to run the game on Linux, MacOS, or Windows by making a terminal appear running the main.py file
#this file is frozen into an executable using cx_Freeze
#this file will be converted into a .exe file using cx_Freeze so that it can be run without prior installation of Python or any modules
#when the .exe file is run for the first time, it will in the background create a folder called "build" which will contain all the necessary files to run the game
#the .exe file will then run the game by running the main.py file in the build folder
