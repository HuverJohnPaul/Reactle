# Reactle
Reactle is a wordle inspired game where users must guess the atoms of a random reaction. They are given hints base off of their previouse guesses to help them guess it. The user is shown the coefficients and subscripts to help them guess off the structure of the reaction. After their first guess they are given hints using colours in the terminal to help them determine the reaction based off the feedback on the accuracy of their last guess. Their goal is to guess the entire reaction correctly in as few attempts as possible, and specifically before 6 attempts as that is the max number of attempts.
