Game Rules: Reactle
The game
Before you can play Reactle, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your name.

When the game begins, you will be presented with a censored chemical reaction. Each unique element in the reaction will be hidden, and instead represented by a number determined by the order they first appear in the reaction. For example, 


Decode the Puzzle
Formulate your first guess by strategically selecting elements based on your understanding of chemical reactions and their structures. To enter your guess, the game will prompt you with a list of each element's number, and you must fill the corresponding number with your guess for what that element is.

Refine your Guesses
Utilize the feedback on the given periodic table from your initial guess and improve your following attempts
Red means the element is not in the reaction
Yellow means the element is in the reaction but in the incorrect spot
Green means the element is in the correct spot

Unveil the Reaction
Element by element, reveal the reaction, celebrate your achievement and absorb the educational insights from each revealed reaction! You have six guesses to reveal the element in; so use your guess strategically. After you finish a game, you will be prompted if you want to play again, if you do type y (for yes).
