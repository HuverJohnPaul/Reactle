# Reactle
Reactle is a wordle inspired game where users must guess the atoms of a random reaction. They are given hints base off of their previouse guesses to help them guess it, and are shown the coefficients and subscripts to help them guess off the structure of the reaction. Their goal is to guess the entire reaction correctly in as few attempts as possible.
